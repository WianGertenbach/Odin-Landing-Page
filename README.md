# Odin-Landing-Page
A landing page project as part of the CSS lesson in The Odin Project. Just HTML and CSS used. 

The landing page is an invitation to Valhalla, feasthall and afterlife of the Norse gods. I decided to stay within the course theme, which I think worked really well. Have a look here: https://wiangertenbach.github.io/Odin-Landing-Page/
